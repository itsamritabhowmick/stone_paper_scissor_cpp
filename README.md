## Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as `g++` or `clang++`.
- **Windows OS** (for `windows.h`): This game uses Windows-specific functions like `system("cls")` and `Sleep()`.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add input validation to avoid incorrect inputs.
- Create a menu for better user interaction.
- Make the code cross-platform by replacing `windows.h` functions.
